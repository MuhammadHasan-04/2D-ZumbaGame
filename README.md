# 2D-ZumbaGame
For my semester's final project, I created a 2D console-based game inspired by Zuma using Assembly 8086. The game features dynamic ball movement, collision detection, and scoring, showcasing efficient use of registers, memory management, and low-level programming skills, while recreating key gameplay mechanics within 8086 architecture.
